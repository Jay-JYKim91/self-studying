HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.
For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.
The figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined with other elelents:

The label tag wraps the text for a specific control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.
<form>
  <label for="name">Name: </label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>

The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.
The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.
The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input type="radio" id="one" name="items">
    <label for="one">One</label>
    <input type="radio" id="two" name="items">
    <label for="two">Two</label>
    <input type="radio" id="three" name="items">
    <label for="three">Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

Add an accessible data picker
<label for="input1">Enter a date: </label>
<input type="date" id="input1" name="input1">

Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.
<p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion <time datetime="2021-01-19">today</time>, which ended in a draw.</p>

CSS's magic can also imporve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format(like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative persentation(like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.
.sr-only {
  posision: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}
%This is not the same thing%
display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users.
Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.

HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.
HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.
<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>

The HTM tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, nevagive, or zero) determines the behavior.
Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically received keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them. Here's an example:
<div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>
A negative value indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when die used for a pop-up window is activated), and is beyond the scope of these challenges.
The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or highter.
Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values(2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.
It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This techinique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.
<div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>
<div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
